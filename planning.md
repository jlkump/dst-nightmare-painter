Current Plan:
- Change the font of the player to use a cursive styled font:

- The character is a painter that uses nightmare fuel as the ink to their art. They themselves are a nightmare creature

- Hunger replaced by dread meter. 
    - Dread is increased by "consuming" nightmare fuel or pure horror. (Also reduces sanity and gives a small amount of health). Dread solidifies the appearance of the player. Dread can be spent on abilities and reducing maximum dread can be used to create minions. 
    - When Dread is above a certain limit, the player is materialized and can interact with the world more effectively.
    - When Dread is low, the player becomes incorporeal, meaning that they will occasionally drop tools, can't wear armor or hats, have to perform a task to pick items up and take longer to perfom any tasks. (The exception is any item tagged with the shadow tag. These items remain normal).

- Damage bonus dependant upon the phase of the moon when on the surface. Full moon makes 0.8 damage modifier, new moon is 1.2 damage modifier. When in the caves, constant 1.0 until the rifts are active, then 1.5 damage modifier with +5 planar damage. 

- Can create animated minions that extend the player's functionality.

- A small creature that takes hits for the player. Made of bone that eventually breaks.

- Has capacity for different minions within their body, limited by the amount of dread the player has. 

- Holding/Wearing any Lunar items will quickly drain dread and drain health when dread is zero.
