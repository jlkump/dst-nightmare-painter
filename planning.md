## Overview
- The character is a painter that uses nightmare fuel as the ink to their art. They themselves are a nightmare creature and their body is the ink they use for their art. The art is different symbols of the ancient shadow language and creates different shadow creatures to help them.

## Stats
- Health: 100
- Sanity: 100
- Dread:  200

## Dread
- Hunger replaced by dread meter. 
    - Dread is increased by "consuming" nightmare fuel or pure horror. (Also reduces sanity and gives a small amount of health). Dread solidifies the appearance of the player. Dread can be spent on abilities for creating minion helpers. 
    - When Dread is above a certain limit (numeric, not percentage), the player is materialized and can interact with the world more effectively.
    - When Dread is low (numeric, not percentage), the player becomes incorporeal, meaning that they will occasionally drop tools, can't wear armor or hats, have to perform a task to pick items up and take longer to perfom any tasks. (The exception is any item tagged with the shadow tag. These items remain normal).
    - Dread slowly drains over time. When dread is zero, sanity begins to drain.
    - Holding/Wearing any Lunar items will quickly drain dread and drain health when dread is zero. 

## Damage
- Damage bonus dependant upon the phase of the moon when on the surface. Full moon 0.8 damage modifier, new moon 1.2 damage modifier. 
- When in the caves, constant 1.0 until the rifts are active, then 1.5 damage modifier with +5 planar damage.

## Minions
- Can create animated minions that extend the player's functionality. Any creature can be re-called back to the player's body and sent back out to perform tasks.
    - A small creature that takes hits for the player. Made of bone that eventually breaks
    - A large creature that can tank hits but moves slowly (looks like Rasp)
    - A fast spiky creature that attacks quickly but has low health
    - A small creature made of only teeth that chomps down on trees nearby
    - A shadow on the ground that dissolves items into the player's inventory
- Has capacity for different minions within their body. There is a separate limit on the number within the body as well as a limit on the number that can be sent out to have effect in the world.
    - Sending out minions from within the body reduces the maximum dread of the player as well as their maximum health. The minion type will determine by how much the player's dread and health are reduced. Thus many small minions could be sent out but multiple big minions could not.
    - The capacity for minions within the body is another system, similar to WX's circuit system. There are slots that the player can place minions into and when the slots fill up, minions have to be disbanded if more are to be added. This is where the artworks come in. The player places artworks into these slots to determine what minions they have available. 
- When a minion dies, the maximum dread and maximum health spent is returned to the player (without replenishing what they already have) and the player loses some sanity depending on how substantial the minion was. The artwork used to create them is also destroyed. (Perhaps place ruined artwork in the slot?)

## Artworks
- Artworks are created with a combination of shadow materials (bone shards, fossil fragments, dark tatters, dreadstone) as well as dread and paper. 

## Shadow Rift Modifications
- When the shadow rifts are active, the player is always materialized.
- The player gains the afformentioned damage bonus of 1.5 and planar damage of 5.
- Rift materials unlock new artworks that can be made.
